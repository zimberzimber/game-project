        TO DO:
- Give drawn sprites the ability to draw a portion of the sprite (cutting it off, like a progress bar)
- Add a UI scale factor
- Add controller support
- Add a method which generates button or pane sprites and adds them to the sprite collection

        Done:
X Changed light renderering to use triangles instead of points to prevent it from relying on maximum point size
X Canvas size is now based on its actual size, and locked to a 4:3 aspect ratio (handled through Main.ts)
X Have spatial sound be applied based on a tag, instead of type (so that they can be played through UI (for example) without being spatial)
X Corrected spatial sound panning
X Added directional light
