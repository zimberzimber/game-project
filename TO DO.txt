        TO DO:
- Give drawn sprites the ability to draw a portion of the sprite (cutting it off, like a progress bar)
- Add a UI scale factor
- Add controller support
- Add a method which generates button or pane sprites and adds them to the sprite collection

        Done:
X Sprite frame definitions are now always pixel based, shader determines their 0-1 coordinates while rendering
X Forced light color and hardness to clamp between 0 and 1
X Removed old SpriteManager from code
X Text now scales with transform scale
X Convert all shaders to 300 es format
X Replaced the custom modulo method in light shader with the built-in mod function (didn't know it was there lmao)
