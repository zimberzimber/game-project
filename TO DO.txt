- Have the sprite definitions go by pixels, and get converted to 0-1 in runtime
X Add a UI renderer
- Find a solution to Scene and UI renderers doubling texture IDs
X Convert into a state machine, where each states can be defined separetly, and manage the game in their own way
- Scene and UI rendering should be based on entity type
X Add the ability to control sound panning and volume based on its origin and camera position
- Add pitch controls to sound
X Add lighting
X Have lighting be affected by hardness
X Cleanup and organize renderer texture handling
X Move Webgl render option enabling to the respective render functions, enabling disabling them based on the specific renderer
X Have sound definitions be pulled from a readonly dictionary by ID, instead of having to pass an object each time
X Rewrite some components to store data for webgl instead of calculating it all the time. Update it when relevant data was changed.
    Shouldn't apply the DebugDraw as they won't be visible in regular gameplay
    but attaching an extra observer to a transform and notifying it will impact performence
    Setting everything up to subscribe/unsibscribe when debugDraw changes is too much effort for too little gain

(SCRAPED) Have the colission checker return a point of colission or null instead of a boolean of whether there was a colission or not
(SCRAPED) Have the transform observer pass the old transform as a parameter
