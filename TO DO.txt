        TO DO:
- Add Ribbon particles
- Add a system to create 'maps' which load entities into the game state
- Have the convolver impulse disconnect from nodes when the impulse is removed, or have it connect through initialization instead of when adding an impulse
- Instead of having the level spawn things based on position, make them spawn when the level has passed a certain length (different for each entity)
- Timed entities, with a time to live, and an 'on died' callback

        Ideas:
For the worm, Ori jumps off Ku, asks Ku to wait outside.
She does, and after a few moments a rumbling begins, ori pops out of the side (After the worm escape)

Have component/entity delition only mark it for deletion, and the actual deletion occur at the end of the update loop.
