        TO DO:
- Change canvas size setting to be handled based on its actual size, instead of through Main.ts
- Give drawn sprites the ability to draw a portion of the sprite (like cutting it off)
- Add a UI scale factor
- Add controller support
- Add a method which generates button or pane sprites and adds them to the sprite collection

        Done:
X Added particle opacity controls
X Added bounding radius calculation to particles, and made particle instances draw only when they're in view
X Corrected particle force resistence, and the option to have them face in the direction they're pushed
X Added the option to have particles start off a random frame (whether the sprite itself is animated or not)
