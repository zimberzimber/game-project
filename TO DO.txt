        TO DO:
- Add Ribbon particles

        Done:
+ Right clicking on the game canvas no longer opens the context menu.
+ Added alignment controls to ButtonBasic
+ Text draw directive converts non-text to text and no longer crashes on undefineds/nulls
+ Changed input handler to work based on event.code instead of event.keyCode
+ Settings no longer pass references to objects, but clones instead. Also fixed passing an object with the same reference not updating the settings.
+ Added a key remapping menu
+ Added simple button with text creating utility
+ Moved window background to a separate composite UI entity
+ WindowBasic now has a close callback, and a closing method
+ Components and entities now add themselves to a target entity (or the entity tree root for entities without a parent)
+ Entities can now be disabled
+ Entities and components can now check if they're enabled/disabled through heirarchy
+ Added Ui utility
+ Added an utility to get an origins offset based on the alignments of a parent element and the subject
+ Input now observes the control map setting, and sets up a keymap accordingly on its own
+ Added an options menu
