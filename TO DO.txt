        TO DO:
- Add Ribbon particles
- Add a system to create 'maps' which load entities into the game state
- Have the convolver impulse disconnect from nodes when the impulse is removed, or have it connect through initialization instead of when adding an impulse
- Instead of having the level spawn things based on position, make them spawn when the level has passed a certain length (different for each entity)
- Timed entities, with a time to live, and an 'on died' callback
- Fix the bug where energy and health damage burst cannot be on the same depth offset in resource UI
- Add a global data storage for things like score, and keeping track of statistics
- Add collectibles, and score

        Ideas:
For the worm, Ori jumps off Ku, asks Ku to wait outside.
She does, and after a few moments a rumbling begins, ori pops out of the side (After the worm escape)

Have component/entity delition only mark it for deletion, and the actual deletion occur at the end of the update loop.

Bonus levels with space themes
Space Rangers music duh

        Potential Visual Styles:

- Doodled + 16bit(?) music/sfx
The game is "doodled" by either Ku or Ori, and is told like a plan or daydreaming of a future adventure together.
Intro and outro should be drawn properly, depicting the "before" and "after" the doodling begins.

- Fairytale 
The game would basically be ori-esque-lite

- Added life, energy, and score pickups
- Split force component into one with gravity, and one without.
- Added a method to clear IDB databases
- Added methods for pulling sprites out of the sprite manager and not getting a warning if the sprite doesn't exist (for particle use mostly)
- Added a level score goal bar
