        TO DO:
- Add Ribbon particles
- Add a system to create 'maps' which load entities into the game state
- Have the convolver impulse disconnect from nodes when the impulse is removed, or have it connect through initialization instead of when adding an impulse
- Instead of having the level spawn things based on position, make them spawn when the level has passed a certain length (different for each entity)
- Timed entities, with a time to live, and an 'on died' callback

        Done:
- Entities now disable themselves before deletion
- Components now disable themselves before deletion
- Added a method for getting all entities of type
- Corrected generic function getting by type to allow obtaining via abstract classes
- Entities and components are checked if they're enabled before calling their update
- Image draw directives (other than tiled) can now have a number for size to scale the image linearly
